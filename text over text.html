Militant commander Farooq Malik Bitta, also a former student of Pushkar, 
breaches Pushkar Nath's house. Karan hides in a rice container but is found
and shot by Bitta. Pushkar and his daughter-in-law Sharda plead for their lives.
Bitta compels Sharda to eat rice soaked in Karan's blood in exchange for their lives. 
After Bitta and his gang leave the house, Pushkar takes Karan to the hospital and 
requests his doctor friend Mahesh Kumar to save Karan's life. However, the hospital
gets taken over by militants, who forbid the hospital staff from treating non-Muslims.
Subsequently, Karan succumbs to injuries from the gunshots.
